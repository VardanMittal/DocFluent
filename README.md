# DocFluent
(A website to translate Documents of different formats)

Language barriers prevent free flow of information. It can cause simple tasks in day to day life to be difficult. in India alone as many as 121 languages are spoken, an individual is not expected to learn all these languages to overcome the language barrier. This is where we can make use of technology to bridge the gap between different communities speaking different languages. Government documents are generally not available in different native languages and it can become very difficult for individuals to understand the official language of Documents and different their rules and regulations. The website DocFluent will not only translate government documents but any textual content into 24 language pairs. The users will get the downloaded version of their translated file in the same as input format.
